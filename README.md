Raxa JSS EMR is an OpenMRS based Health Information System.

This project is an open source initiative to enhance care delivery, administration, quality improvement, research and patient access at JSS by digitizing information as it currently flows in its rural hospital and community outreach programs.  It is being created using free, open source tools and is available for anyone's usage in India and beyond.
