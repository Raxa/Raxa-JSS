Raxa-JSS
========
The Raxa JSS EMR is an information management system ("Raxa") designed for and to be initially implemented at the [Jan Swasthya Sahyog (JSS)](http://jssbilaspur.org), a healthcare non-governmental organization (NGO) working in a largely rural, underserved community in India.
Raxa JSS EMR is an OpenMRS based Health Information System.

This project is an open source initiative to enhance care delivery, administration, quality improvement, research and patient access at JSS by digitizing information as it currently flows in its rural hospital and community outreach programs.  It is being created using free, open source tools and is available for anyone's usage in India and beyond.
For more information, please see our wiki:
<https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/Raxa+JSS+EMR>

The project uses HTML5, CSS and JavaScript as the front-end technologies and uses REST webservices provided by OpenMRS.
This uses Sencha Touch 2 as the Framework for MVC and UI.
