BMI Calculator UI Elements

This UI is made solely in ExtJS. Calculations can be verified from another javascript UI.

It has the following components:-
•	Enter Weight in Kgs
•	Enter Height in cms
•	Calculate BMI Button
•	BMI Value Textbox (Read only textbox)
•	Draggable and Resizeable Window

NOTE: Apart from this, I have added a relatively small javascript, (with temporary textboxes, button and a chart), which seems informative (segregation of Indices) and the chart is a nice addition to the app/site. It can be omitted from the page at any time.  Right now, it is commented out.
This can be integrated with ExtJS Charts in the future.
