JSS - Medical Assistance System
=========

[JSS (Jan Swastyha Sahyog)][1] is a healthcare non-governmental organization, situated at Bilaspur, India. MAS is basically a medical information interface being designed for the non-literate user/patient.


Overview
--------

Currently, we are working on providing the following information to the user:
- Medicine Schedule : Which medicines have been prescribed, when to take them, what things should be kept in mind while taking the medicine
- Next Appointment : Reminders for the next deoctor's appointment
- General Instructions : General instructions provided by the doctor, such as what kind of diet the patient should stick to etc.


Why?
----

A large fraction of the Indian population is unable to read or write. The figures vary but they hover around 25%. Keeping this fact under consideration, we decided to develop a health-care module designed in such a way that the non-literate or semi-literate user can easily comprehend the information provided.

Usage
-----

This interface is being developed using [Sencha Touch 2][2]. Sencha Touch 2, a HTML5/CSS3 mobile application framework.
