 * Kiva does not have a JSON-P API, making it challenging to access their data using a purely client-side
 * application. To get around this, we use Yahoo's YQL service, which acts as a proxy allowing us to use
 * the API as though it was any other data source.
 * 
 * To make this work we've set up a very simple subclass of the ScriptTagProxy, which is a Proxy that lets
 * us load data from a different domain (http://query.yahooapis.com in this case). The only extra logic we
 * add is in buildRequest, where we modify the request url to include the YQL statement we need to perform
 * our search.
 * 
 * See http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/ for more information about YQL.
