                            </li>
                            <li>Focusing on form fields should now automatically adjust them into the viewable area
                            </li>
                            <li>Improved the ability to hide the browser's address bar as much as possible

                            <li>When a Model instance is saved to a server and the server returns a response including data such as the ID to be set on the Model instance, that data is now applied back to the model

                            </li>
                            <li>Fields that have a convert function are populated last so that data in the other fields will already be present

                    API Changes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the xtypes and class names that were modified in this release have been aliased back to the original name, so your code will continue to function. We strongly recommend updating your application code to reference the new names because the aliases will be removed when Sencha Touch 1.0 is released.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, all form field class names omit the Field suffix (e.g. Ext.form.Text instead of Ext.form.TextField). The 'Field' suffix is considered redundant due to already being within the Ext.form.* namespace. All field xtypes now contain the 'field' suffix as xtypes are not otherwise namespaced.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Modified Form Classes
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ext.form.DatePickerField renamed to Ext.form.DatePicker
                            </li>
                            <li>Ext.form.EmailField renamed to Ext.form.Email

                    Release Notes for Sencha Touch 0.99
                </h1>

                    Release Notes: November 3, 2010<br>
                    Version Number: 0.99
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sencha Touch 0.99 has massively improved form and scroller support for all Android devices, as well as a number of bug fixes for all platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With our first Release Candidate imminent, Sencha Touch 0.99 contains a number of API changes intended to make the API clearer and more consistent. We expect this to be the only time we undertake changes of this magnitude and have tried to make this as painless as possible by taking the following steps:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Logging a warning to the console when your application uses a deprecated API
                    </li>
                    <li>Causing the old API function to call the new one so that you can gradually update your application
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Version 1.0 of Sencha Touch will ship without the fallbacks to new functions so we encourage you to update your applications so that there are no logged warnings before that point.
                </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Carousel got major overhaul. Inserting and removing cards now doesn't cause a flicker. Carousel now prepared for future functionality like dynamic loading and wrapping. setCard on a Carousel can now also accept custom animations.

                    This release focused on List, DataPanel, Carousel, layouts and general bug-fixing.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added a commercial beta license which will expire 30 days after the 1.0 final release. Check the license in the SDK for further details.
                    </li>
                    <li>Improved DataPanel. We now have the ability to render components into DataPanels. An example of this is to render an Edit button into a List item. This will allow for many of the requested features on the forums to be implemented more easily. This is also the foundation for List and upcoming NestedList improvements.
                    </li>
                    <li>Refactored the List. The performance of the pinned headers has drastically improved. Added a disclosure configuration option that renders a disclosure button into each list item.
                    </li>
                    <li>Added localization support to the library.
                    </li>
                    <li>Added a lot of functionality to Forms. FormPanel now has a submit() method, Select components can be bound to stores, and added support for more HTML5 properties like autoCapitalize. Minor updates to most field types.
                    </li>
                    <li>Android forms now work better. Select boxes on Android are still broken.
                    </li>
                    <li>Include a new cross-platform JSBuilder that will allow the developer to create a custom build of the library. This can help reduce the file size of the library drastically.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fixed over 15 reported bugs.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Nested Lists are not based on the List component in beta, but will be for final Release.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Maps and Carousel components both respond to swipe events resulting in a carousel transition and a map drag at the same time. These will be disambiguated in the final release.

                    <li>While HTML5 video and audio operate correctly in basic use, when HTML5 video is combined with touch events or transitions, there is a likelihood of browser crashes. These are known WebKit issues.

                    <li>The video component on Android works correctly only with Google sourced videos (YouTube etc.). This appears to be an issue with Android video decoding.

                    <li>Please be aware that HTML5 audio and video tags should be explicitly tested before deployment since there are issues with cross-platform codec operation

                    This release focused on refactoring, simplifying and bug-fixing. We have managed to fix many bugs thanks to the feedback and reports on our forums would like to thank everyone for their comments.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Refactored the Scroller. Now implements actual physics for momentum and bouncing. Improved performance. Also supports direction: 'both'.</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>Improved Carousel. Because of the new Scroller we were able to improve upon our Carousel implementation. It now supports direction: 'horizontal' as well as 'vertical'. Also bouncing on the first and last item in the carousel now behaves correctly.
                    </li>
                    <li>Headers in a grouped List component now scroll along even during the deceleration.
                    </li>
                    <li>Stabilized the Data Package. Added easier ways to define proxies and readers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Improved and expanded current docs, and added missing docs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Made many adjustments and improvements to the other Components.

                    Welcome to the very first public beta release of Sencha Touch. We’re incredibly excited for you to see what we’ve been working on and to get your feedback and comments on what we’ve built!

                <p>
                    Sencha Touch is a Javascript framework for developers creating applications targeted for touch-interface devices such as the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and Android. It lets you create an elegant, consistent user experience with minimal effort, with the skills and tools you already have. It makes extensive use of technologies from HTML5 and CSS3 to provide a native-quality application experience without the use of plugins. Please view the included API documentation and the demo source code for working examples of Sencha Touch applications.
                </p>
