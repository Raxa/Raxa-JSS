                    <p><b>Special Notes:</b></p>
                    <p>Application dependency logic has been tweaked to allow more versatility in specifying dependencies from packages outside your application. As of this release any combination of local and external dependencies should be possible, but you'll need use Ext.Loader.setPath to specify where external dependencies can be found. See the <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2-0/#!/api/Ext.app.Application">updated Application class docs</a> for sample usage.</p>

                    <p><b>Notes:</b></p>

                    <p>Navigation View has been updated so the 'stack' is now based on the <b>items</b> config/collection. This means that if you define more than 1 item in a navigation view, the last item will <i>always</i> be the active item. The animation methods have also been removed from Navigaiton View. Instead, you should change the animation using the view.getLayout().setAnimation() setter instead, just like you would on a Ext.Container.</p>

                    <p>The signature returned in the <b>callback</b> configuration of <b>Ext.util.JSONP#request</b> has changed. Previously it only returned the JSON object. It now returns the success value (Boolean) as the first argument and then the JSON object as the second argument. The class has also been deprecated</p>
                    <p>The sencha-touch-debug.js shipped with Beta 2 now includes deprecated compatibility methods.  Please remember that in order to use the smaller build without compatibility, you will need to fix any deprecation warnings you receive during development</p>
                </div>

                                        used with the data package as with the rest of your applications.</li>
                                    <li>The performance of the data package has been signifigantly improved.</li>
                                    <li>There are some event changes in the Data package and backwards compatibility for the old add, update,
                                        and remove events is not fully in place.  The old events have severe performance implications and
                                        we strongly recommend all developers change to the new addrecords, updaterecord, and removerecords.
                                        In addition we have added a new 'refresh event' to supplant the old 'datachanged event' which was
                                        fired under too many circumstances.</li>
                                    <li>Many issues with LocalStore/WebStore are resolved and this should now work properly.
                                        Please note that assosciated local stores are not in place yet.</li>
                                    <li>Store paging is back in place and operational.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>The event signatures for DataView have been changed to handle both Element based items and Component based items.  In addition the record is now passed on all the item events.</li>
